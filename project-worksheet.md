## Project Description

The final project will be a functioning portfolio website. It will follow minimalistic design principles and be responsive. I prefer minimal and clean design for portfolios so the focus can be on the individual and their skills.   

## Wireframes

?? About page is a requirement, but is it ok that I have this information set in my home page? Or do I need to have a separate about page ??
